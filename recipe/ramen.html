    </h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon miso paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
      <li>4 ounces dried ramen noodles</li>
      <li>
        2 cups sliced vegetables (e.g., mushrooms, bok choy, spinach, or bean
        sprouts)
      </li>
      <li>2 soft-boiled eggs, halved</li>
      <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup cooked protein (e.g., sliced pork, chicken, or tofu)</li>
      <li>Optional toppings: sesame seeds, seaweed, corn, or chili oil</li>
    </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot, combine the chicken or vegetable broth, water, soy
        sauce, miso paste, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Bring the mixture to
        a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let the
        broth simmer for at least 10 minutes to develop the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles
        according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse the noodles under
        cold water to stop the cooking process and remove any excess starch.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the noodles are cooking, prepare the vegetables and protein.
        Blanch the vegetables in boiling water or saut√© them in a pan with a
        little oil until tender. Heat the cooked protein in a pan or microwave
        until warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, divide the cooked noodles evenly among four bowls. Pour the
        hot broth over the noodles, making sure each bowl has an equal amount of
        broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the vegetables, protein, and soft-boiled eggs on top of the
        noodles in each bowl. Garnish with green onions and any optional
        toppings you desire.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy the ramen while it's hot, and feel free to adjust the flavors with
        additional soy sauce, sesame oil, or chili oil, if desired.

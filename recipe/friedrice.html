      variety of ingredients.
    </h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>3 cups cooked and cooled jasmine or long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>
        1 cup mixed vegetables (e.g., peas, carrots, corn, or bell peppers)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup diced cooked protein (e.g., chicken, shrimp, or tofu)</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ol>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until they are softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the mixed vegetables and cooked protein to the skillet, and cook until the vegetables are tender and the protein is heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Push the vegetables and protein to the side of the skillet, and add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil to the empty side. Pour the beaten eggs into the oil, and scramble until they are cooked.</li>
        <li>Stir the scrambled eggs into the vegetable and protein mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir everything together, ensuring that the rice is well-coated with the oil and heated through.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the soy sauce over the rice, and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed the sauce and is evenly colored.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the sliced green onions and sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the fried rice hot, garnished with additional green onions or sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
     </ul>

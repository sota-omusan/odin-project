    <h2>
      Omelette rice, or omurice, is a popular Japanese dish that combines fried
      rice with a tender, flavorful omelette.
    </h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups cooked and cooled white rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup diced mixed vegetables (e.g., carrots, peas, corn, or bell
        peppers)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup diced cooked protein (e.g., chicken, ham, or shrimp)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup, plus extra for drizzling</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over
        medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 3-4
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the mixed vegetables and cooked protein to the skillet and cook for
        an additional 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the
        protein is heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the cooked rice, breaking up any clumps with a spatula, and cook
        until heated through. Add the ketchup, and season with salt and pepper
        to taste. Mix everything together until the rice is evenly coated with
        ketchup. Remove the fried rice from the skillet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Season with a pinch
        of salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
        over medium-low heat. Pour in half of the egg mixture and cook until the
        edges are set but the center is still slightly runny, about 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon half of the fried rice mixture onto one half of the omelette in
        the skillet. Gently fold the other half of the omelette over the rice,
        and carefully slide the omelette rice onto a plate. Repeat the process
        with the remaining egg mixture and fried rice to create a second
        serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle the top of each omelette with additional ketchup, if desired,
        and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
